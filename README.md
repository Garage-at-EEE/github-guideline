# Garage-at-EEE GitHub Organization Guidelines

Welcome to Garage-at-EEE's GitHub organization! These guidelines are designed to ensure consistency, collaboration, and clarity within our projects. Please follow these best practices to maintain a well-organized and productive environment.

## Repository Naming Convention

When creating new repositories within the organization, please adhere to the following naming conventions:

1. **Clear and Descriptive**: Choose a name that accurately reflects the purpose of the repository. Avoid generic names or acronyms that may not be easily understood by others.

2. **Lowercase and Hyphens**: Use lowercase letters and hyphens to separate words in the repository name. This format enhances readability and consistency.

3. **Short and Concise**: Keep the repository name reasonably short, ideally less than 50 characters, while still conveying the primary purpose.

4. **Follow the given format**: When naming, please follow the format given `[YEAR]-[EVENT/INITIATIVE]-[DESCRIPTION]`.

Example: `2020-tnd-workshop-arduino-basics`, `2023-makeathon-group-4`, `2021-escendo-team-21-the-makers`

## Documentation

1. **README**: Every repository **SHOULD HAVE** a `README.md` file at the root level. This file should contain essential information about the project, including a brief description, setup instructions, usage guidelines, and any other relevant information. Please make sure that the documentation is proper and can be understood by someone who doesn't have a clue about your project. We want your code to have a long and lasting life within Garage, so please document with care <3

2. **Inline Comments**: Include inline comments in your code to explain complex sections, tricky logic, or potential gotchas. Well-documented code helps other contributors understand the implementation and purpose.

## Security and Sensitive Information

1. **Sensitive Data**: Avoid committing sensitive data such as passwords, API keys, or personal information to repositories. Use environment variables or configuration files (ignored by version control) for such purposes.

2. **Vulnerabilities**: Regularly scan dependencies for security vulnerabilities and keep them up-to-date. Consider using tools like Dependabot or similar.

## Collaboration and Communication

1. **Be Respectful**: Treat other contributors with respect and professionalism. Disagreements may arise, but always focus on finding solutions rather than dwelling on problems.

2. **Communication**: Use GitHub issues and PR discussions for project-related conversations. Consider using GitHub discussions platform for more informal discussions.

By following these guidelines, we can maintain a productive, collaborative, and well-documented Garage@EEE GitHub page. Happy coding!
